Arguments: a manifest file

What it would do (ver .1):
  Parse the manifest file.
  For each test set:
    Determine the machine/guest setup required (making sure passwordless key-based authentication exisists.. probably a requirement in the guest definition)
    Use machine and guest definitions to create that setup
    create enoguh forks/threads to run all tests in the test set
    start all tests at the same time

Thinks to keep in mind for the future:
  Hooks!
